1. In the Double Push counterfactual, should we consider two critical points?
1.a If not, which point should be the critical point - the first or second push?

2. How long should the counterfactual simulation, the ticks after the crticial point, run for?

3. For the No Touch simulation, there is no point of collision. Should the counterfactual simply remove the the Agent?
3.a Is there a need to apply noise to the velocity of the Fireball?
3.a.1 If so, when and why?

4. For the Dynamics Simulation 4 (both Patient and Fireball), what should we consider the critical point?

5. Should noise be applied to the Fireball?

6. Should we not simulate how-dependence?
6.a Look at simulations 21,22,25,26

Notes:

- Blender
- CSM
- Stimuli from Leyla (question about effort and animations)
- Creating 'calibration scenarios' and rerunning experiments
- New GitHub branch at time of submission with Singularity container for reproducibility 
- 

Notes from meeting:
- Exp 1 replicates Moral Kinematics as close as possible
- Exp 2 adds on with good 


- Rerun our experiments with Blender videos
